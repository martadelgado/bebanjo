                I’m a front-end developer who’s lived in a few different places but I’m currently based in sunny Barcelona. I’m originally from the US (Louisiana to be exact) but both of my parents are from Spain so this country has always had a huge piece of my heart. After a few years of living in California and working in the wine industry (how I learned to stop worrying and love the wine), I decided I wanted a career change as I was gaining interest in learning how to code. I wasn’t sure how to go about this but I eventually landed upon a coding bootcamp here in Barcelona which I decided to give a try. I figured I’d learn the foundations of programming, but what I learned is that I liked it so much more than I could imagine! It was more challenging than any field I had worked in before and the satisfaction of solving a complex problem is something I get on the daily. Without a doubt, I consider my career change a change for the better, and I look forward to everything I have left to discover.

                Although I don’t know the full ins and outs of your products, I do know they will be a challenge that I am eager to jump into. It’s important to work with a product you’re interested in and can learn from and I think I can count on Bebanjo's products to provide both of those. 
                Bebanjo is a wonderful company facing fast growth, and I think I’d be a great addition to grow alongside the company. Aside from my technical knowledge, I can provide so much to this company whose values align so well with mine. Bebanjo values diversity and inclusivity, 
                something I believe is so important in this industry. That’s why I volunteer twice a month mentoring students at <a class="codebar-link" href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</a>, whose mission is to teach underrepresented people programming in a safe and inclusive environment. It also helps me reaffirm what I know as a developer 
                and I always have a good time meeting and working with people with a passion to learn. It tends to be contagious :)

              <span>
                So, my main interest is Javascript but that’s such a general topic I’ve decided to narrow it down a bit so you can understand what I like and have to offer. These are all topics I have some experience with and what I am most interested diving deeper into:
                <ul>
                  <li style="list-style-type: circle;padding-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Vue.js</strong> - With so many popular JS frameworks these days, I recently decided to incorporate Vue.js into my current company’s codebase. It’s lightweight and seemed like the most practical option when I was looking through new technologies from which we could benefit. Since it was new for everyone in my team, it was something I had to teach myself but I do feel I have a good grasp. I’m very interested in working more with Vue and see all it has to offer.</li>
                  <li style="list-style-type: circle;padding-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Performance</strong> - Web performance is something I need to "deal" with from time to time but I’ve also grown to love it. It’s challenging and at times frustrating but its benefits are invaluable. Performance improvements is something everyone should take seriously as it makes a huge impact on the user! There are so many steps, big and small, you can take to better performance and this includes anything from refactoring the code you write to taking full advantage of a module bundler.</li>
                  <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><strong>Front-end Testing</strong> - This is the concept that is most new to me as I’ve recently had the task to implement functional tests at my company. I wish I would have worked with this sooner as it’s a huge life saver! This has changed my mindset when writing new code and has served as a gateway for other front-end testing. Next up, I plan to learn integration and unit testing.</li>
                </ul>
              </span>
            </div>

          <section id="conclusion">
            <div>
              <span class="section-title conclusion">In conclusion...</span>
              <span>
                  Hopefully this cover letter has helped you get to know me a little better and has shown you what I can offer Bebanjo. While I may not be your typical developer -- no one ever guesses that I do that for a living -- I think that’s a good thing! 
                  I have great communication skills and I have a diverse background that will let me bring a unique perspective to your company. I don't bounce around jobs and I stay at a company when I feel valued. I have a great deal of motivation to learn and I look forward to being part of a team where I can grow and contribute growth. 
                  As time passes, I'm only getting better at what I do and I'm looking to share that with a company that I love <span class="red">&#9829;</span>.
